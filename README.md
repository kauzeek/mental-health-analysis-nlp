This project focuses on analyzing mental health-related text using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to detect signs of conditions such as depression, anxiety, or stress by processing user-generated content like social media posts or forum discussions. Techniques include text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, emotion classification, and machine learning models for mental health prediction. This tool can support early detection and raise awareness, but it is not intended for clinical diagnosis.
